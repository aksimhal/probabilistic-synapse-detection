## Readme for Probabilistic fluorescence-based synapse detection

Thank you for visiting the paper's code repository.  Here, you'll find links to download the data and the necessary code needed to run the synapse detection code yourself.  

If you'd like to explore the algorithm itself, run /runme/sample_runme/run_sample.m   This runme runs a few example queries on sample data (a tiny portion of data from Weiler et al, 2014) inlcuded in the repository.  

To download the conjugate array tomography data or the chessboard data, navigate to /ndio for instructions.  

#### Original Data references.

#### Questions?
I'm excited to see how folks are going to use this!  Drop me a line if you have any questions, or if you'd like to talk about anything in the paper - anish.simhal@duke.edu
